      "description": "The purpose of this project will be to run/present a youth entrepreneur program twice a year focusing on around 10 identified young people (age 18 to 25) lasting about 12 weeks each.  The program will be practical as much as possible. The program will also focus on linking these young people with established businesses and organizations.  Post-program support will also be available to keep track of the successes and failures of the program.  The program will also align and work with existing NGO's within Noordhoek to pull resources and create synergies.  Working the Bergriver Municipality and the Velddrif Chamber of Business will also be relevant and significant, especially in terms of selecting the youth and mentorships.",
